## DNA Sequencing
### DNA.java is program that determines whether there is a protein in a strand of DNA.
The genome of an organism stores all the genetic information necessary to build and maintain that organism. It is an organism’s complete set of DNA.

DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as:
- A: Adenine
- C: Cytosine
- G: Guanine
- T: Thymine

A protein has the following qualities:

- It begins with a “start codon”: ATG.
- It ends with a “stop codon”: TGA.
- In between, each additional codon is a sequence of three nucleotides.
